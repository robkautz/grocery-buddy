Tags: pasta, italian-american, dinner

Ingredients:
- 3 tbsp unsalted butter
- 1 medium yellow onion, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
- 1 pinch red pepper flakes
- kosher salt to taste
- 4 1/2 oz tomato paste
- 14 1/2 oz whole peeled tomatoes
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 1 lb short tubular pasta (penne or rigatoni)
- 1/4 cup vodka
- 2 oz Parmigiano-Reggiano, grated

Instructions:
1. Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat.
2. Add onion, garlic, red pepper flakes, and a pinch of salt; cook until onions are very soft, about 15 minutes (do not brown).
3. Stir in tomato paste and cook until thick and fragrant, about 3 minutes.
4. Add tomatoes with their liquid; simmer and crush tomatoes with a spoon until slightly thickened, about 10 minutes.
5. Stir in heavy cream until combined.
6. Blend sauce until very smooth, then return to the pot and season lightly with salt.
7. Cook pasta in salted boiling water until just shy of al dente (about 3 minutes less than package directions).
8. About 1 minute before adding pasta, stir vodka into the sauce and bring to a gentle simmer.
9. Transfer pasta to the sauce with 1/2 cup pasta water.
10. Cook over high heat, stirring constantly, until pasta is al dente and coated, about 3 minutes; add more pasta water as needed.
11. Remove from heat and stir in Parmigiano-Reggiano until smooth and creamy.
12. Taste and adjust salt; serve immediately with more cheese if desired.
