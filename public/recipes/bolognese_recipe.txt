Servings: 4
Tags: dinner, pasta, high-fiber, lighter

Ingredients:
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1/2 lb lean ground beef (93% or 96% lean)
- 1 tbsp ground turmeric, heaping
- 1 medium onion, diced
- 2 medium carrots, diced
- 2 ribs celery, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/2 tsp chili flakes (or to taste)
- 1 jar (24 oz) tomato sauce, no added sugar
- 2 tbsp tomato paste
- 1 cup low-sodium chicken stock
- 1/2 cup milk (dairy or unsweetened plant milk)
- 1 1/2 cups cooked brown lentils (or 1 can lentils, drained and rinsed)
- 8 oz whole-wheat spaghetti
- 2 medium zucchini, spiralized or cut into thin noodles
- 1 1/2 tsp salt (or to taste)
- 1 tsp black pepper (or to taste)
- 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese, finely grated (optional)

Instructions:
1. Heat olive oil in a large wide pan over medium-high heat.
2. Add the ground beef and cook, breaking it up with a spoon, until browned.
3. Add the turmeric, 1/2 tsp salt, and several grinds of black pepper. Stir to coat the beef.
4. Add the onion, carrots, and celery. Cook until the vegetables soften and begin to brown, 5 to 8 minutes.
5. Add the garlic and cook for 30 to 60 seconds.
6. Stir in the tomato sauce, tomato paste, chicken stock, and milk. Scrape the bottom of the pan to release browned bits.
7. Add the chili flakes and lentils. Stir to combine.
8. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer uncovered for 20 to 30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until thickened.
9. Taste and adjust seasoning with more salt and black pepper if needed.
10. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
11. Cook the whole-wheat spaghetti until just shy of al dente, about 1 minute less than package directions.
12. Use tongs to transfer the pasta directly from the pot into the pan of sauce.
13. Add the zucchini noodles to the pan.
14. Toss the pasta, zoodles, and sauce together over medium heat for 2 to 3 minutes until everything is coated and the zucchini softens.
15. Add a splash of pasta water or stock if the mixture seems dry.
16. Taste and adjust seasoning again if needed.
17. Serve with grated Parmesan cheese if desired.
