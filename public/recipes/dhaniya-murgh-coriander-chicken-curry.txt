Feeds: 2

INGREDIENTS
- 4 boneless and skinless chicken thighs
- 1 small onion
- 4 garlic cloves
- 1 inch ginger
- 250 g natural Greek (thick) yogurt
- 1/2 tsp turmeric powder
- 1/2 tsp chili powder
- 1 tsp coriander powder
- 1/2 tsp garam masala
- 15 g fresh coriander (cilantro)
- 2 tbsp oil
- Salt, to taste

INSTRUCTIONS
1) Prep:
   Finely chop the onion. Mince the garlic and ginger. Finely chop the fresh coriander.

2) Brown the chicken:
   Heat the oil in a pan over medium-high heat.
   Add chicken thighs and sear until lightly browned on both sides.
   Remove chicken and set aside.

3) Cook the aromatics:
   In the same pan, add the onion and cook until softened.
   Add garlic and ginger and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.

4) Add spices:
   Stir in turmeric, chili powder, coriander powder, and garam masala.
   Cook for 30–60 seconds, stirring, so the spices bloom.

5) Add yogurt:
   Reduce heat to low.
   Add the yogurt gradually, stirring continuously to keep it smooth (avoid boiling to prevent splitting).

6) Simmer:
   Return the chicken to the pan. Season with salt.
   Cover and simmer until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce thickens (about 15–20 minutes), turning the chicken once.

7) Finish:
   Stir in most of the fresh coriander.
   Taste and adjust salt. Serve hot, topped with the remaining coriander.

NOTES
- If the sauce looks too thick, add a splash of water.
- Keep the heat low after adding yogurt to prevent curdling.
