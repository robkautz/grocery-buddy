INSTRUCTIONS
1) Make the meatball mixture:
   In a large bowl, mix together ground beef, Italian sausage, breadcrumbs, parmesan cheese, egg, chopped parsley, garlic powder, and salt.

2) Shape the meatballs:
   Using about 2 teaspoons of the mixture at a time, roll into mini meatballs and set aside.

3) Brown the meatballs:
   Heat a saucepan over medium-high heat. Add 1 tablespoon olive oil.
   Once hot, add meatballs and cook about 5–6 minutes total, turning frequently so all sides cook.
   Remove meatballs with a slotted spoon and set aside.

4) Sauté vegetables:
   Chop and prepare all vegetables.
   Heat a large dutch oven over medium-high heat and add the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil.
   Add onion, carrots, and celery. Cook about 5 minutes, until vegetables begin to soften.

5) Add garlic + seasonings:
   Add minced garlic and the dried spices/seasonings.
   Cook 2 more minutes, stirring.

6) Add liquids:
   Pour in chicken broth and water. Stir to combine.

7) Simmer soup:
   Add browned meatballs and acini de pepe pasta.
   Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium and simmer for 15 minutes.

8) Finish with spinach:
   Turn off heat and stir in baby spinach until wilted.

9) Serve:
   Serve hot, optionally topped with fresh parmesan.

STORAGE
- Refrigerate leftovers in airtight containers for 3–4 days.
